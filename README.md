### Introduction

Anki-Cards-Generator app is used for generation Anki or Anki-like cards for language learnings.
The following functions are implemented:

1. Generation of dataset of words on any topic, like something specific e.g "food", or a type of words - like "verbs for B1 level", or any other - like "mood description", "basic phrases for communication at an airport".

2. For the generated words or user-selected words, translation to any language of choice will be generated.

3. For the pairs of words, simple image will be brought from the internet to enhance assosiciative learning of the language.

4. Anki deck will be generated which later can be imported into Anki app.

5. Next step, would be to integrate the system with voice over API, so for each of the phrases user could get an audio.
